# FabLab_Tennisball_Thrower
This code was created for a school course. It is used to program a Arduino Uno to power a slingshot that throws dogtoys. 

For this code, Platform.io is used. For the code to run, two Platform.io libraries will be needed. 
-	Ultrasonic – Eric Simoes
-	Servo – Michael Margolis

Furthermore, an ultrasonic motion sensor and a 180 degree servo will be needed.
